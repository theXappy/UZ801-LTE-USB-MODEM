## Intro
I bought this "4G LTE USB Dongle WiFi" from AliExpress around 2023.  
After playing with it for a while, I decied to document all the quirks/tricks I've learned.  
I'm not the first one to research this thing, so some of the link below are to other GH repos by other, smarter people.  
SoC seems to be: `Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 (MSM8916)`  
USB Hardware IDs: `VID_05C6 PID_90B6`  
Modem Identifiers (fetched with AT commands):

   - Their device doesn't look the same (+ I had root on by default) but mine also deployed test-keys so the same logic applies.

### ☎️ Modem

2. [Sniffing 3G/4G Traffic via QCSuper & Wireshark](https://github.com/P1sec/QCSuper) (by P1sec).
   - Just run the `./qcsuper.py --adb --wireshark-live` afte enabling ADB (which enables DIAG as well, I think)

### 📱Screen Control
1. [Screenshots + Disabling Screen Timeout](https://github.com/u0d7i/uz801) (by u0d7i)
   - Don't use the screenshots manually, use the next link (adbcontrol) for 2-way interactions.
   - The device is running Android KitKat (4.4.4, SDK 19) so neither scrcpy nor Vysor work.
2. [View & Control Device "Display" via adbcontrol](https://github.com/AlienWolfX/UZ801-USB_MODEM?tab=readme-ov-file#view-device-display) (by AlienWolfX)
3. [Change UI Language to English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8krFZxOXuiE)
   - I tried u0d7i's way and it didn't work for me. Using the Settings app via remote control did.

### ⚡ UART
UART pins are arranged in a row, on the side without the SIM slot.  
Mapping, assuming the USB connector points down:  
* Topmost: VCC
* 2nd from top: GND   
* 2nd from bottom: TX
* Bottommost: RX  
![uart](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/421b63f6-ae34-4b81-8250-f27c9c5bff09)

Connect using default parameters in PuTTY except:
* Session -> Baud Rate: 115200
* Connection -> Serial -> Flow Control: None
You'll be greated with a shell, the user is `shell` and has the following `id` values:
```
shell@msm8916_32_512:/ $ id
uid=2000(shell) gid=1007(log) context=u:r:init_shell:s0
```
In comparison, ADB shell defaults to the `root` user and these values:
```
root@msm8916_32_512:/ # id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) context=u:r:shell:s0
```
Anyway, using `su root` from the `shell` user just switches to root ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯.

#### EDL via UART pins
Previously, [AlienWolfx's repo](https://github.com/AlienWolfX/UZ801-USB_MODEM) used to mentiond that you can ented "EDL mode" by shorting the GND and VCC connector.  
I didn't try that myself but that info might be helpful to some future reader.
