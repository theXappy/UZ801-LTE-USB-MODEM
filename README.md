## Intro
I bought this "4G LTE USB Dongle WiFi" from AliExpress around 2023.  
After playing with it for a while, I decied to document all the quirks/tricks I've learned.  
I'm not the first one to research this thing, so some of the link below are to other GH repos by other, smarter people.

   - Their device doesn't look the same (+ I had root on by default) but mine also deployed test-keys so the same logic applies.

2. [Sniffing 3G/4G Traffic via QCSuper & Wireshark](https://github.com/P1sec/QCSuper) (by P1sec).
   - Just run the `./qcsuper.py --adb --wireshark-live` afte enabling ADB (which enables DIAG as well, I think)

### üì±Screen Control
1. [Screenshots + Disabling Screen Timeout](https://github.com/u0d7i/uz801) (by u0d7i)
   - Don't use the screenshots manually, use the next link (adbcontrol) for 2-way interactions.
   - The device is running Android KitKat (4.4.4, SDK 19) so neither scrcpy nor Vysor work.
2. [View & Control Device "Display" via adbcontrol](https://github.com/AlienWolfX/UZ801-USB_MODEM?tab=readme-ov-file#view-device-display) (by AlienWolfX)
3. [Change UI Language to English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8krFZxOXuiE)
   - I tried u0d7i's way and it didn't work for me. Using the Settings app via remote control did.
